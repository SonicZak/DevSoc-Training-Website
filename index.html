          <h2>Geometry and Measurement</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The formula to calculate the circumference of a circle is: C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius.</li>
            <li>The formula to calculate the area of a circle is: A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.</li>
            <li>The diameter of a circle is the longest distance across the circle, passing through its center. It is twice the radius of the circle.</li>
            <li>The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Properties</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A circle has no beginning or end, and it is continuous.</li>
            <li>A circle has no corners or edges.</li>
            <li>All points on the circumference of a circle are equidistant from the center.</li>
            <li>The center of a circle is the point in the very middle of the circle.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The ancient Greeks believed that the Earth was a circle.</li>
            <li>The concept of pi (π) was first discovered by the ancient Babylonians.</li>
            <li>The value of pi is approximately 3.14, but it is an irrational number, which means it cannot be expressed exactly as a finite decimal or fraction.</li>
            <li>Circles have been used in various cultures for spiritual and symbolic purposes, such as the yin-yang symbol in Chinese culture.</li>
